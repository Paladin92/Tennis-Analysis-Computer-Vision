# Tennis Analysis Project

## Introduction
This tennis analysis project aims to create a comprehensive tool for analyzing tennis matches through video analysis. By detecting and tracking players and tennis balls, as well as identifying court key points, the project provides valuable insights into the game, including player positioning, shot analysis, and overall match dynamics.

## Features
- **Player and Ball Detection and Tracking:** Using the YOLO object detection model, the project detects and tracks players and tennis balls throughout the video.
- **Court Key Points Detection:** A custom CNN model is used to estimate court key points, aiding in the analysis of player positions relative to the court.
- **Performance Metrics:** Analysis of shots made, players' speed, distance covered, and ball in/out status.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
